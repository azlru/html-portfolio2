        <h1>The Best Movies According To Jezazel</h1>

        <h2>My Top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

        <h3>Twilight</h3>
        <p>
        This is my most go-to movie.<br />
        I really like dis movie I could watch it all over again.<br />
        Because who will ever get tired of Edward's beautiful face, right???<br />
        </p>
        
        <h3>Harry Potter</h3>
        <p>
        A year ago, I was so bored;<br />
        I read it before watching because dami kong time noh.<br />
        But, I didn't know I would like it this way.<br />
        Totally unexpected for such a "picky" watcher like me.<br />
        P.S I really fancy Ron and the twins. My boys!! <3 <br />
        </p>
        
        <h3>Tune in for Love</h3>
        <p>
        It is a Korean movie I really love.<br />
        Never fails to make me cry.<br />
        (im such a crybaby :< tho)<br />
