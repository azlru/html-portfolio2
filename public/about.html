<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I want you to know</br>
  I'm a mirrorball</br>
  I'll show you every version of yourself tonight</br>
  I'll get you out on the floor</br>
  Shimmering beautiful</br>
  And when I break it's in a million pieces</br>
</p>

<p>Hush</br>
  When no one is around, my dear</br>
  You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes</br>
  Spinning in my highest heels, love</br>
  Shining just for you</br>
  Hush</br>
  I know they said the end is near</br>
  But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes</br>
  Spinning in my highest heels, love</br>
  Shining just for you</br>
</p>

<p>
  And they called off the circus</br>
  Burned the disco down</br>
  When they sent home the horses</br>
  And the rodeo clowns</br>
  I'm still on that tightrope</br>
  I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me</br>
  I'm still a believer but I don't know why</br>
  I've never been a natural</br>
  All I do is try, try, try</br>
  I'm still on that trapeze</br>
  I'm still trying everything</br>
  To keep you looking at me</br>
</p>

<p>
  Because I'm a mirrorball</br>
  I'm a mirrorball</br>
  I'll show you every version of yourself</br>
  Tonight</br>
</p>
